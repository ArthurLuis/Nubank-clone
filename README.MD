## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed with the following technology:

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- TypeScript
- Styled Components

## :construction_worker: Running the project

- To clone the project via HTTPS, run this command:\*\*

`git clone https://github.com/ArthurLuis/nubank-clone.git`

- Run this command to install dependencies (If you don't have npm or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed in your computer, first you need to install)

`yarn install` or `npm install`

- Then to finally run the project, run this command

`yarn start`

- A window is going to open and then you have two options: running the project on your mobile phone (reading the QR code with the "expo" app) or on a mobile simulator (Android Studio or Xcode).
